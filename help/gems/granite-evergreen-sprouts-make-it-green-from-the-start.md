title: Evergreen Sprouts - Make it green from the start
description: Recently, the AEM project vision concentrated more on customer experience, product quality being its central piece. This yielded a need to create a more streamlined and standardized release process. The "Evergreen Sprouts" project complements the existing Evergreen with customizable validation pipelines owned by individual teams. It provides test execution and coverage data for validating commits, releases and PRs, automatic pull requests to Quickstart and a lot more. Join us for a demo session to see how this solution can make your life easier.
