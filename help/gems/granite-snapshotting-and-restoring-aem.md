title: Snapshotting and Restoring AEM using Docker and CRIU
description: In this presentation you will see how to snapshot and restore AEM (both the running process and the files) using an experimental integration between Docker and CRIU.  You will also see Snappy, a proof of concept implementation of a system designed to automate the process of creating, storing and restoring snapshots.

*Delivered June 30, 2016*

**Presented by:**

Andrei Stefan Tuicu, Graduate diploma intern, Adobe

**Additional note:**
 
Docker is not a supported Platform. What this means is that there is no support for running AEM inside Docker in production.But there are successful POCs and tests done with AEM inside Docker.So Docker is still in the evaluation phase and might be supported in future. But that is a PM decision.
