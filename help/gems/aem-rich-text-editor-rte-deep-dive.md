title: Deep Dive on implementation details of stores, modules and segments in ContextHub
description: This Gems sessions is dedicated to have a closer look on implementation details of ContextHub stores of different types, using different persistence layers. Custom modules implementation (both via code and configuration using base module renderer), as well as how to organize modules in separate ContextHub modes. Lastly, we will see how ContextHub segment traits are working, how to implement custom comparator and how to instantiate segments programatically.
