title: How to improve your patent submission
description: Whenever you come up with a good idea, you have the challenge of how to describe it.  You always ask yourself how much you need to put in for a good submission and how detailed it needs to be.  The patent attorneys at the patent team will use this session to present insights on how to write a good invention submission.  They will also provide guidelines as to what information the reviewers at the patent review committee typically look for.
