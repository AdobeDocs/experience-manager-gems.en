description: While AEM work is pretty self-contained, we AT/AAM/AA consultants working with AEM need to collaborate with our AEM counterparts. This session gives a brief overview of AT/AAM/AA integrations using DTM, the things we look for, and why it all matters. If you ever wanted to know why people actually use AT/AAM/AA, or even AEM, this is your session.   AT = Adobe Target  AAM = Adobe Audience Manager  AA = Adobe Analytics  DTM = Dynamic Tag Management
