description: "Wondering who this greenbot guy is? He works hard to validate any pull-request open for the master branch in cq/quickstart and automatically merge your code if the build and tests pass. This way, issues are caught before making their way to the master branch. You can push to a branch or ask him nicely to re-trigger the pipeline, after fixing the issues. His mission: As the AEM teams have grown in numbers and in size, knowledge and code ownership is more distributed.  We have a suite of 2000+ automated functional tests + battle-tested java tooling + an incredible testing infrastructure. But these testing jobs are almost always RED - because they are run after each piece of code checked in. The greenbot guy aims to make these tests GREEN for every build of the master.
