title: HTTP API Framework
description: Starting with AEM 6.3, the AEM team is establishing a framework that will both simplify and standardize the use of APIs that are exposed to internal and external consumers, including ISVs, SIs and other Adobe products. This gem session will describe that syntax and how to leverage a new framework that accelerates development of those endpoints using an annotation strategy. The framework handles all the boiler plate code, including Sling internals, HTTP routing and JSON serialization, enabling developers to focus on business level resources and functionality for consumers, who in turn enjoy a consistent API design.
